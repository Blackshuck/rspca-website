        <h4>RSPCA Cambridge Trusteeship</h4>
        <p>
All RSPCA local branches are independent charities in their own right, although they are governed by the <a href="rspcabranchrules.pdf">RSPCA Rules for Branches</a>. Each branch is run by a committee of a minimum of 7 and maximum of 14 trustees.
        </p>
              <p>
Trustees may be appointed in either of two ways:

<ul><li>By annual ballot of the branch members at an AGM.   </li>
<li>Co-option during the year by vote of the current branch trustees</li></ul>
        </p>
              <p>
Only adult RSPCA members of at least 3 months standing are eligible to stand for election at an AGM, but co-optees are not required to be members, so we often use this as a way for interested people to get some experience of what it involves.
</p></div>

      <div class="large-8 columns">
<p>Branch trustees attend monthly committee meetings and many are also involved in the more day-to-day running of the branch. In fact, most RSPCA branches have few or no paid staff and branch trustees do a large amount of practical work in addition to decision-making.
<br>
The RSPCA Cambridge branch covers a territorial area stretching from Littleport in the north to just south of Royston and from Gamlingay to Newmarket in a west-east direction.
<br>
We run a low-cost animal clinic in Cambridge which treats around 4,000 animals each year, and each year we rehome around 200 animals, mostly cases brought in by RSPCA inspectors or injured strays.</p>

        </div>
  <div class="row">
     <div class="large-8 columns">
We have an annual turnover of just under Â£250,000 and are constantly striving to improve in order to provide more services, as we feel we are only scratching the surface of the level of need.
<br>
The branch has three charity shops, which do employ paid managers, and generate the largest part of our regular income stream.
<br>
For more information on branch activities see our <a href="ClinicOverview.pdf">clinic overview and FAQs</a>.
<br>
We are looking to recruit potential trustees who are already <a href="http://www.rspca.org.uk/getinvolved/becomeamember">RSPCA members</a> and would be interested in standing for election at our AGM in June, or non-members interested in being co-opted following our June AGM.
<br>
If you are a branch member and would like to stand for election, or to nominate another branch member, please download and complete a <a href="Nomination%20form.doc">nomination form</a>. If you want to stand, but don't know anyone who is a branch member and able to propose you, please contact us.
