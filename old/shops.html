                        <p>Much of our fundraising is carried out through the activities of our three charity shops. Our Newmarket shop recently moved to new premises in Market Street and we also have two shops in Cambridge, one in Burleigh Street and the other in Mill Road that specialises in secondhand books. You can find these on the map in our About Us page.

                            Please support us by buying from our shops and donating items! If you are a UK tax payer, please take a few moments to complete a gift aid form when you donate at either of the Burleigh Street or Newmarket shops. Doing this means we can reclaim tax when your donated item is sold, which increases the value of your donation by 28 pence in every pound.

                            If you are interested in volunteering in the shop, please print off our volunteering form , complete your details and bring it in to one of the shops. We would particularly like to hear from anyone who would like to reactivate our online sales via eBay and Abe Books.</p>

                    <p>You can find Market Street at the entrance to the Guineas shopping arcade just off the High Street. Market Street is pedestrianised, but if you would like to drop off donations by car you can drive up to the back entrance of the shop via the access road which leads off Exeter Road. It may be advisable to phone the shop in advance to make sure they are aware that they need to let you in.




                        We need more volunteers to work in the shop and to help with collecting donated goods to sell.

                        If you might be interested in volunteering, please drop in for a chat with Lynne or Debbie, our shop managers.</p>

                    <p>The RSPCA Cambridge secondhand and antiquarian bookshop is packed with lots of excellent books at reasonable prices. We need more volunteers with an interest in books and/or music (or just willing to carry books up and down the stairs!) to help out. If you could help please email us at <a href="mailto:info@rspca-cambridge.org.uk">info@rspca-cambridge.org.uk</a> or phone the Burleigh Street shop on 01223 312 802.

                        We are still collecting donations of clothing, linens, china, etc. etc. at the bookshop to sell at 61 Burleigh St. Only the best items will go out on sale at the shop, but even worn or damaged textiles can be sold for recycling and raise valuable funds to support our work.</p>
