        <p>Contrary to what most people think, the RSPCA is not like a National Health Service for animals - the RSPCA does not receive automatic funding and local branch animal welfare services entirely depend on voluntary income and fundraising activities carried out both locally and nationally. We must find £2,500 per month to keep our animal clinic running and another £2,000 per month to pay for boarding and care of animals waiting to be found new homes.</p>

    <div class="large-8 columns">
        <p>All RSPCA branches are separate charities affiliated to the national RSPCA, which provides us with a basic grant annually. We are individually responsible for raising the remainder of the funds needed to run the local services which we provide, and all extra money we can raise is kept to be spent locally.</p>
        <p>We pay an annual contribution into the Regional Fund, which is used to support projects which will benefit all the branches within the Eastern Region. This contribution is calculated on a sliding scale depending on the amount of funds a branch has in reserve. Branches like us with less than two years operating costs in their reserves pay a contribution of £480, and this amount rises to a possible maximum of £12,000 if a branch were to have more than 10 years funds in reserve. (The aim of this is to achieve a fair redistribution of funds from branches which have more money than they really need to ones which are struggling).</p>

        <p>We urgently need more support, whether through donations or volunteering, as we are no longer able to provide the range of services that we could a year ago. Recently we had to stop providing emergency support for pet owners who cannot afford vet fees. We recommend that people who are in receipt of state benefits and who might have trouble paying vet bills should register with our <a href="clinic.html">clinic</a>. Veterinary charges at the clinic are roughly one third that of private vets.</p>

        <p>You can become a member of the RSPCA by <a href="http://www.rspca.org.uk/getinvolved/becomeamember">joining via the internet </a>. Membership will give you voting rights on important issues and the chance of joining your local branch committee as well as simply supporting the society, so it is very worthwhile if you want to help animals.</p>
